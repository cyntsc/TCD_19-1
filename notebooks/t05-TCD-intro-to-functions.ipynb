    "The purpose of programming is to make our life easier by speeding up the process of making certain operations on data. So far we've used pre-built and customed made functions, but we still have to understand the structure and syntax of functions in python. **Functions** make code reusable and thus is one of the most useful parts of coding. From now on, we will focus on making functions after we've made our data analysis workflows in our  jupyter notebooks. "

    "To code it in python, the function has to be **defined** using the `def` keyword, followed by the function's name (automatically colored in blue) and a colon. The [PEP-8](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/) guideline recommends to name functions with more than one word should be linked by underscores (e.g. `my_function`). \n",

    "After the colon, if you click enter, python automatically makes an [indentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style). After that it is highly recommended to have a doc string with a brief description of the function, its arguments, and its outputs. The doc string is usually written inside triple quotes. Furthermore, after the doc string, there is a block of code which is the operation of the function and finally, to get the result of the function, you need to write `return` and the name of the variable of your output, without parenthesis.\n",
